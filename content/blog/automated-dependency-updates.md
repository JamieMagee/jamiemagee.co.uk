At [CopenhagenJS](https://copenhagenjs.dk) in August I was able to share my work on [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com/)—a universal dependency update tool—and how you can use it to save time and improve security in software projects.

If you want to find out more about Renovate you can find us [on GitHub](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate).
